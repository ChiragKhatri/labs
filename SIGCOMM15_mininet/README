This lab replicates the original SIGCOMM2015 one but in Mininet.

Simply run in two different terminals:

```bash
python network.py -n
```
 And

```bash
python network.py -c
```

The first command will spawn the network (square topology), and you will land
in the mininet CLI. The second on will spawn an instance of a controller running
the Simple algorithm.
