This repository lists sample labs to show how fibbing works.

The labs under [mininet/](https://github.com/Fibbing/labs/tree/master/mininet)
are to be run in conjunction with mininet. The easiest way is to
use the virtual machine provided in
[Fibbing/virtual-machine](https://github.com/Fibbing/virtual-machine).
